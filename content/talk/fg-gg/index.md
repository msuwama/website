summary: How fundamental groups and Galois groups are connected
abstract: Fundamental groups and Galois groups are two important groups we learn in our qual classes, however, analogies between them do not get mentioned normally in those classes. In this talk, we will discuss the surprising connection between the two groups and apply it to solve the inverse Galois problem for $\\mathbb{C}(t)$.
