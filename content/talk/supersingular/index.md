summary: Elkies' theorem on the existence of infinite supersingular primes
abstract: Supersingular elliptic curves are special types of elliptic curves that occur in positive characteristics. And we say that a rational prime is a supersingular prime for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if the reduction is supersingular. In this talk, I will discuss mainly about Elkies' theorem on the existence of infinite supersingular primes for an elliptitc curve.
